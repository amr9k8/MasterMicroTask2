### Why I Used Java?
I Choosed Java because :
1) it's a high-level language that have garbage collection which handle allocation and deallocation of memory. 
2) I Can Write The Code Once  And Run Anywhere As it's  JVM Which compile the Java program to bytecode, and run the application on any other platform that supports a Java Virtual Machine
3) it's Strong OOP as java embraces  the object-oriented programming
